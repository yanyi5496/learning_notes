#### 引言

In recent years, research about wireless remote control robot is one of the topic that has been attracted many interest for researchers and robotic engineers because of the convenient practical usage.
		近年来，无线遥控机器人因其方便的实际应用而引起了研究者和机器人工程师的广泛关注。

One of the method to achieve this is using WIFI connection as there are many WIFI connection usage that has been used everywhere such as home, office, or industrial. Although there are many research about WIFI remote control robot at present, most of them must be connected in the same access point between robot and installed application.
		实现这一点的方法之一是使用WIFI连接，因为有许多WIFI连接的使用已经被广泛使用，如家庭、办公室或工业场所。虽然目前对WIFI遥控机器人的研究很多，但绝大多数的WIFI遥控机器人必须连接在同一个接入点上。

In the past, control and tracking between robot and application proves to be challenge as researchers must manage the connection for both robot and application by their own.
		在过去，机器人与应用之间的控制和跟踪是一个挑战，因为研究人员必须自己管理机器人与应用之间的连接。

---

Communication protocol is also one the issue when applying to the single chip microcomputer or microprocessor, where battery usage and one-to-many communication must be considered.
		在应用于单片机或微处理器时，通信协议也是一个必须考虑电池使用和一对多通信的问题。

HTTP is one of the protocol that has been used for control over WIFI. However, as HTTP is not an actual bidirectional communication, practical usage when implement into remote control robot can be a cumbersome because managing the connection requires to specify the connection ports (and might also the IP address) for each components in the network.
		HTTP是用于控制WIFI的协议之一。然而，由于HTTP并不是一种实际的双向通信，在远程控制robot中实现时的实际使用可能会很麻烦，因为管理连接需要为网络中的每个组件指定连接端口（也可能是IP地址）。

This also leads to another problem when the control must be able to achieve through the internet connection, where controlling from anywhere is necessary. Moreover, HTTP protocol has a large size of packet, which consumes a lot of power, especially for battery powered device.
		当控件必须能够通过internet连接实现时，这也会导致另一个问题，因为需要从任何地方进行控制。另外，HTTP协议具有较大的数据包容量，消耗了大量的能量，尤其是对于电池供电的设备。

However, due to the currently increasing of cloud computing platform and reemergence of the “internet of things” ideal that has been conceptualized by [2] in the year 1999, this open many possibilities for achieve the idea of controlling the device or the robot throughout the internet connection from anywhere, especially when MQTT protocol has become available for public usage. With the small footprint and “publish/subscribe” concept, connection management with devices in the network has become simpler and also more suitable when additional components must operate concurrently with the existed system. Moreover, there are many cloud platform that support MQTT protocol for conducting machine to machine communication such as adafruit.io, NETPIE, with possibly more increasing. With the advantages of MQTT protocol, it is also possible to implement into the research field of remotely robot control, or knowledgeexchange of the machine over the cloud platform[1].
		然而，由于目前云计算平台的不断增加，以及1999年[2]提出的“物联网”理想的重新融合，这为实现从任何地方通过互联网连接控制设备或机器人提供了许多可能性，特别是当MQTT协议可供公众使用。随着小型化和“发布/订阅”概念的出现，当附加组件必须与现有系统同时运行时，网络中设备的连接管理变得更简单，也更适合。此外，有许多云平台支持MQTT协议来进行机器到机器的通信，如adafruit.io、NETPIE，而且可能会越来越多。利用MQTT协议的优点，也有可能在云平台上实现远程机器人控制或机器知识交换的研究领域[1]。

This study will implement the MQTT cloud platform for remotely control robot based on “publish/subscribe” concept. At the same time, this study also apply GPS module for robot position tracking in order to study 2-ways communication between robot and control application. Then, the evaluation of the system is conducted to determine the delay of transmission time of the system.
		本研究将以「发布/订阅」的概念，来实现遥控机器人的MQTT云平台。同时，为了研究机器人与控制应用之间的双向通信，本研究还将GPS模块应用于机器人的位置跟踪。然后对系统进行评估，确定系统的传输时延。

		本论文的其余部分安排如下：第二节为本研究提供了相关背景，第三节为进行研究的系统总体设计，第四节为评估系统的实验设置，第五节为第四节提供的评估实验结果，第六部分为研究结论。

#### 背景

A、 MQTT协议

Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)[3] is a lightweight communication protocol invented by IBM and Eurotech specifically for Machine to Machine (M2M) communication. It has been designed for minimized network bandwidth and resource where network latency or low bandwidth network must be considered. MQTT protocol has fixed header 2 bytes for indication of packet type and length of remaining payload data as can be seen in Fig 1.
		消息队列遥测传输（MQTT）[3]是IBM和Eurotech专门为机器到机器（M2M）通信发明的一种轻量级通信协议。它是为最小化网络带宽和资源而设计的，其中必须考虑网络延迟或低带宽网络。MQTT协议具有固定的报头2字节，用于指示包类型和剩余有效负载数据的长度，如图1所示。

---

Communication by using MQTT is based on “Publish/Subscribe” concept. In order to be communicate, device must specify the topic to communicate with, which might contain only one device or many. Only device subscribes in specify topic can be communicate with.
		使用MQTT进行通信基于“发布/订阅”概念。为了进行通信，设备必须指定要与之通信的主题，该主题可能只包含一个或多个设备。只能与指定主题中的设备订阅通信。

---

With such a small sizes of data packets, MQTT proves to be on of the appropriate approach when one-to-many communication is required for low-bandwidth or high latency network. Another protocol that claimed to be lightweight is Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which also has a small sizes of header, but still larger than MQTT (which CoAP has 4 bytes of header) [].
		对于如此小的数据包，当低带宽或高延迟网络需要一对多通信时，MQTT被证明是合适的方法。另一个声称是轻量级的协议是受限应用程序协议（constrainted Application protocol，CoAP），它也有一个较小的报头，但仍然大于MQTT（其中CoAP有4个字节的报头）[]。

B、NETPIE

This study employ NETPIE[4] as cloud platform for M2M Communication between robot and application for control and tracking. NETPIE is the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud platform that has been developed for machine to machine (M2M) communication using MQTT protocol to communicate between devices, which can be microcontroller, computer, or other embedded device based on the concept of internet of things.
		本研究以NETPIE[4]为云平台，实现机器人间的M2M通信，并应用于控制与跟踪。NETPIE是一个平台即服务（Platform-as-a-Service，PaaS）云平台，它是为使用MQTT协议在设备之间进行机器到机器（machine-to-machine，M2M）通信而开发的，可以是基于物联网概念的微控制器、计算机或其他嵌入式设备。

---

In order for device to be connected to NETPIE, microgear library requires to be installed on the device and given application ID, application key code, and application secret code to each devices for NETPIE authentication. The connection concept of NETPIE is displayed at Fig 2.
		要使设备连接到NETPIE，需要在设备上安装microgear库，并为每个设备提供应用程序ID、应用程序密钥代码和应用程序密码以进行NETPIE身份验证。NETPIE的连接概念如图2所示。

C、Device Communication in NETPIE NETPIE中的设备通信

Operation of NETPIE is an Event-Driven based, which requires to design the action of each device to handle the current event that has been occur. For instance, if device receive the message, it must read the message and determine the action for every of each incoming message. For this research, the concept has been apply for robot motion control and GPS coordinate receiving.
		NETPIE的操作是基于事件驱动的，它要求设计每个设备的操作来处理已发生的当前事件。例如，如果设备接收到消息，它必须读取消息并确定每个传入消息的操作。在本研究中，此概念已应用于机器人运动控制及GPS坐标接收。

---

Device communication in NETPIE can be archived by using the given function in the microgear library, which are “chat” and “publish” function. Chat function can be considered as “one-to-one” communication, which sender requires to specify the name of receiver device and the message to be transfer.
		NETPIE中的设备通信可以通过microgear库中的给定函数存档，即“聊天”和“发布”功能。聊天功能可以看作是“一对一”的通信，发送方需要指定接收设备的名称和要传输的消息。

---

“Publish” function, on the other hand, is “one-to-many” communication, which sender must indicate the conversation topic in order to communicate with other devices. It should be noted that only devices that subscribed to the same specify topic can receive the message while others cannot (based on the principle of MQTT communication).
		另一方面，“发布”功能是“一对多”通信，发送方必须指明对话主题才能与其他设备通信。需要注意的是，只有订阅同一指定主题的设备才能接收消息，而其他设备不能（基于MQTT通信的原理）。

D、Raspberry Pi 2 Model B

Raspberry Pi[5] is a credit card-sized single-board computer introduced in 2012 by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Although it has been developed with the intention for educational purpose, it has now been attract many interest for more professional and research usage as it operate similar to desktop computer at an affordable cost. With the capable of internet connection, it is possible to be apply for remote communication over the internet when compare to the other similar single board computer at much higher price [6]. Currently, the highest performance model is Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, which has been adopted for this research.
		覆盆子Pi[5]是由覆盆子Pi基金会于2012年推出的一款信用卡大小的单板电脑。虽然它是为了教育目的而开发的，但由于它以可承受的成本运行类似于台式计算机，因此现在已经吸引了许多人对其更专业和研究用途的兴趣。由于具有互联网连接能力，与其他类似的单板计算机相比，价格更高，因此可以应用于互联网上的远程通信[6]。目前，性能最高的模型是覆盆子Pi 2模型B，本研究采用了该模型。

The main processor for Raspberry Pi 2 Model B is a 32-bits System on Chip (SoC) Broadcom BCM2836, which includes a 900 MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU, built-in audio processor, communication hardware (LAN), and VideoCore IV graphics core with additional 4 USB 2.0 ports. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B also consists of 1G RAM memory chip and microSD Flash memory, which the latter function as a main hard drive for Raspberry Pi’s processor.
	Raspberry Pi 2 B型的主处理器是一个32位的片上系统（SoC）Broadcom BCM2836，它包括一个900兆赫的四核ARM Cortex-A7 CPU、内置音频处理器、通信硬件（LAN）和VideoCore IV图形核心，还有4个USB 2.0端口。Raspberry Pi 2 B型还包括1G内存芯片和microSD闪存，后者作为Raspberry Pi处理器的主硬盘。

---

Another advantage of Raspberry Pi computer is the support of printed circuit expansion boards called “Hardware Attached on Top (HAT)” inspired from the Arduino’s Shield boards. These expansion boards can be connected to the 40 pins GPIO connector to perform any specific task according to the HAT board functionality design.
		覆盆子皮电脑的另一个优点是支持印刷电路扩展板，称为“硬件连接在顶部（帽子）”的灵感来源于Arduino的屏蔽板。这些扩展板可以连接到40针GPIO连接器，以执行根据帽板功能设计的任何特定任务。

E、GPS模块

In order to locate the position of the robot, GPS module has been apply for outdoor positioning. In this study, Adafruit Ultimate GPS HAT board has been chosen for use in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi for receiving GPS coordinate via Serial communication port. GPS module is based on MediaTek MT3339 chipset[7]. According to the specification of the board, this module support sensitivity at 165 dBm and has current draw at 20 mA. This HAT board also support the usage of external antenna with u.FL connector for using in the area without clear sky view.
		为了定位机器人的位置，GPS模块已经应用于室外定位。本研究选用Adafruit终极GPS帽板配合覆盆子Pi，通过串行通讯口接收GPS坐标。GPS模块基于联发科MT3339芯片组[7]。根据董事会规范，本模块支持敏感性为165 dBm，电流消耗为20毫安。此帽板还支持在没有清晰天空视图的区域使用带u.FL连接器的外部天线。

#### PROPOSED SYSTEM OVERVIEW 拟议系统概述

One issue of the WIFI-based robot control system is the communication between robot and control application. In the past, WIFI-based robot control system are mostly demand developers to create the TCP socket for devices such as [8] and [9]. Using traditional socket programming technique also can be the cumbersome if there are any additional components in the network as developer needs to manage the communication protocol manually, especially when many-to-many Machineto-Machine communication needs to be taken into consideration. With the publicly available use for MQTT protocol, some of the research related to remotely robot control had adopted the MQTT for their own work such as [10] and [11], which proves to be an effective solutions due to lower packet sizes. However, using MQTT for remotely robot control over cloud platform has not been popularized yet as there are not many MQTT support platform at that time.
		基于WIFI的机器人控制系统的一个问题是机器人与控制应用之间的通信。过去，基于WIFI的机器人控制系统大多要求开发人员为[8]和[9]等设备创建TCP套接字。由于开发人员需要手动管理通信协议，特别是需要考虑多对多机通信时，如果网络中有任何附加组件，使用传统的socket编程技术也会很麻烦。随着对MQTT协议的公开使用，一些与远程机器人控制相关的研究已经将MQTT应用于他们自己的工作中，如[10]和[11]，这被证明是一个有效的解决方案，因为包的大小较低。但是，由于当时MQTT支持平台不多，所以在云平台上使用MQTT进行机器人远程控制还没有普及。

Designing the system is based on 2 principle: 1) Controlling robot should be archive anywhere and anytime as there is an internet connection. 2) Designed system must be able to allow new component or new system to be compatible to the existing system. “Internet of things” concept has been implement into the system by applying cloud platform to be the center of the communication between application and the robot. Details of the designed system can be described below:
		该系统的设计基于两个原则：1）控制机器人应在有互联网连接的情况下随时随地存档。2） 设计的系统必须允许新组件或新系统与现有系统兼容。将云平台作为应用与机器人通信的中心，在系统中实现了物联网的概念。设计系统的详细说明如下：

A、Overall System

The system consists of the three main components, NETPIE cloud platform (which act as communication center), control and tracking application, and WIFI based robot. The overall system is shown in Fig 5.
		系统主要由三部分组成：NETPIE云平台（作为通信中心）、控制与跟踪应用、WIFI机器人。整个系统如图5所示。

B、机器人设计

As the cloud-based control system, designed robot must be able to connect to the internet in order to communicate with the cloud platform. The robot for this research has been developed based on Raspberry Pi 2 Model B as the main processor and connected with the Adafruit GPS HAT board for receiving GPS coordinate and sending to PC application via cloud platform. Python has been chosen as programming language as NETPIE has library support for using with Python.
		作为基于云的控制系统，设计的机器人必须能够连接到互联网，才能与云平台进行通信。本研究的机器人以树莓Pi 2 B型为主要处理器，与Adafruit GPS帽板相连，通过云平台接收GPS坐标并发送到PC应用。选择了Python作为编程语言，因为NETPIE提供了与Python一起使用的库支持。

C、Control and Tracking Process  控制和跟踪过程

Controlling robot motion can be done by sending control command in form of message via NETPIE to the robot, which is waiting to receive the command. Lists of motion control command and data (in parenthesis) consists as follows: Forward (F), Backward (B), Turn Left (L), Turn Right (R), and Stop (S). Process of remote control via NETPIE has been displayed as flowchart at Fig 7.
		控制机器人的运动可以通过NETPIE以消息的形式发送控制命令给等待接收命令的机器人。运动控制命令和数据列表（括号中）如下：前进（F）、后退（B）、左转（L）、右转（R）和停止（S）。通过NETPIE进行远程控制的过程如图7所示。

---

At the same time, robot is connected with Adafruit GPS HAT board to receive NMEA format data via serial communication port ttyAMA0 and extract GPGGA data format as it contains details of latitude and longitude, which will be used for robot position tracking. Flowchart of robot send GPGGA data is at Fig 5 and GPGGA format data from GPS module can be seen as displayed in Fig 6.
		同时，机器人与Adafruit GPS帽板相连，通过串行通信端口ttyAMA0接收NMEA格式的数据，并提取包含纬度和经度细节的GPGGA数据格式，用于机器人位置跟踪。机器人发送GPGGA数据的流程图如图5所示，来自GPS模块的GPGGA格式数据如图6所示。

---

Tracking robot position can be achieve by inputting satellite map image file into the application, which can be obtain from Google Maps, Bing Maps, or any other maps application that provide the satellite image.
		跟踪机器人位置可以通过将卫星地图图像文件输入应用程序来实现，该应用程序可以从谷歌地图、必应地图或提供卫星图像的任何其他地图应用程序获取。

---

In Google Maps, coordinate value is display in form of decimal degrees. However, coordinate received from the GPS module is in decimal minute form. Therefore, conversion of coordinate data is required before it can be apply. In this case, Latitude and longitude data must be extracted from GPGGA data. Then, convert the extracted decimal minute data into decimal degree for map plotting.
在Google地图中，坐标值以十进制度数的形式显示。然而，从GPS模块接收到的坐标是十进制分钟形式。因此，在应用之前，需要对坐标数据进行转换。在这种情况下，纬度和经度数据必须从GPGGA数据中提取。然后，将提取的十进制分钟数据转换为十进制度数进行地图绘制。

#### EXPERIMENT SETUP 实验装置

In order to evaluate the proposed system, an experiment has been conducted by given robot’s pathway in the area outside the Engineering Building, Bangkok University as can be seen at Fig 7. Personal computer use for this experiment is MSI GE60-0ND Laptop, which based on Intel Core i7-3630QM processor unit. Application run on this laptop and wirelessly connect to wireless router ASUS RT-AC68U. Although the router itself has 802.11ac technology supported, the connection technology for the experiment is based on 802.11n as laptop’s WIFI module only support 802.11b/g/n technology.
		为了评估所提出的系统，在曼谷大学工程大楼外的区域，通过给定的机器人路径进行了实验，如图7所示。本次实验使用的个人电脑是基于英特尔酷睿i7-3630QM处理器的MSI GE60-0ND笔记本电脑。应用程序在此笔记本电脑上运行，并无线连接到无线路由器ASUS RT-AC68U。虽然路由器本身支持802.11ac技术，但实验的连接技术基于802.11n，因为笔记本电脑的WIFI模块仅支持802.11b/g/n技术。

As the system is cloud connection-based, latency is one of the aspect that should be consider. In this study, Edimax EW7811Un has been adopted for the robot. It support maximum data rates at 150 Mbps, USB 2.0 connection, and plug &amp; play usage with Raspbian OS as it already contains firmware for this WIFI module. During the experiment, robot has been connected to 3G router for internet connection, which currently support maximum data rates at 21 Mbps due to promotional usage of service provider.
		由于系统是基于云连接的，延迟是应该考虑的方面之一。在本研究中，机器人采用了Edimax EW7811Un。它支持150 Mbps的最高数据速率、USB 2.0连接和Raspbian OS即插即用，因为它已经包含了这个WIFI模块的固件。在实验过程中，机器人已经连接到3G路由器进行互联网连接，由于服务提供商的推广使用，目前支持21mbps的最大数据速率。

---

In order to determine the performance of the system. Calculation of the transmission delay has been taken into the account. In this study, the calculation is the time taken of data transmission from application or robot to the access point start from USB port as the data is transmitting through WIFI USB adapter. According to [12], maximum data rates of USB 2.0 is at 480 Mbps. The transmission time of data packet can be achieve by (1)
以确定系统的性能。传输延迟的计算已考虑在内。在本研究中，计算的是当数据通过WIFI-USB适配器传输时，从应用程序或机器人到从USB端口开始的接入点的数据传输所花费的时间。根据[12]，USB 2.0的最大数据速率为480mbps。数据包的传输时间可通过（1）实现

​								Transmission time = Packet size/Bit Rate (1) 

---

As for NETPIE connection, both robot and application has been given to access application name “RobotControl”, which has been created in NETPIE’s key management page. User account has been created as “free usage” for this experiment. According to NETPIE, every devices must be connected under the same application ID, application key, and application secret code for free usage account. Both robot and application also has been given the name as “pierobot” and “appnode” respectively, which can be set by using “setalias” function of microgear library.
		至于NETPIE连接，robot和application都被赋予了访问应用程序名“RobotControl”的权限，该应用程序名已在NETPIE的密钥管理页面中创建。用户帐户已创建为此实验的“免费使用”。根据NETPIE的说法，每个设备必须以相同的应用程序ID、应用程序密钥和应用程序密码连接，才能使用免费帐户。robot和application分别被命名为“pierobot”和“appnode”，可以通过microgear库的“setalias”函数进行设置。

---

Name of the device that has been assigned by “setalias” function can also be considered as topic conversation for each device. By given device name for both robot and application, communication topic has been assigned by NETPIE as:
		由“setalias”函数分配的设备名称也可以视为每个设备的主题对话。根据机器人和应用程序的给定设备名称，NETPIE将通信主题分配为：



---

As can be seen, the topic size of “pierobot” is at 31 bytes, while “appnode” topic size is 30 bytes. This will be taken into the calculation of transmission time for both robot and application on PC.
		可见，“pierobot”的主题大小为31字节，“appnode”的主题大小为30字节。这将被纳入机器人传输时间的计算和在PC机上的应用。

#### 五

The system evaluation has been conducted by running the control application on Laptop described in IV. By controlling direction, robot must sending reply message to the application to let user know the status of robot movement by applying “chat” function in NETPIE library. Chat message contains “topic” and “movement message” as can be seen in Fig 12.
		系统评估是通过在笔记本电脑上运行第四章描述的控制应用程序进行的。通过控制方向，机器人必须向应用程序发送回复消息，通过在NETPIE库中应用“聊天”功能让用户了解机器人的运动状态。聊天信息包含“主题”和“移动信息”，如图12所示。



---

Fig 13 shows the robot GPS tracking result as it moves along the pathway that has been planned as described in Fig 10. Coordinates data has been received and plotted to display robot’s position in real-time as long as internet connection is intact.
		图13示出了机器人GPS沿着已规划的路径（如图10所述）移动时的跟踪结果。只要网络连接完好，就可以接收并绘制坐标数据，实时显示机器人的位置。

---

Table I shows the packet transmission time for both application and robot. According to the experiment setup that has been described in section IV, both robot and application have different packet size and bit rate support (150 Mbps for PC and 21 Mbps maximum for the robot). Because of this, transmission time of robot sending GPS data is significantly higher than the time when application send control command as robot has lower communication bit rate because of 3G router promotional usage. This can be improve by using higher bit rate support network equipment. However, as the proposed system is cloud-based connection system, there are another factors need to be considered such as bandwidth, load at server side, network traffic, etc.
		表1显示了应用程序和robot的数据包传输时间。根据第四节中描述的实验设置，robot和应用程序都有不同的包大小和比特率支持（PC为150mbps，robot为21mbps）。因此，由于3G路由器的推广使用，机器人发送GPS数据的传输时间明显高于应用程序发送控制命令的时间，因为机器人具有较低的通信比特率。这可以通过使用更高比特率的支持网络设备来改进。但是，由于该系统是基于云的连接系统，还需要考虑带宽、服务器端负载、网络流量等因素。

This papers has proposed the study of using MQTT cloud platform for remotely control robot and GPS tracking. By applying MQTT as the communication protocol, the proposed system has benefit from the lower overall packet size, thus result the lower transmission time when compared to the traditional HTTP protocol. Furthermore, according to MQTT communication principle, the system has the advantage for further development as it allows new system or application to be implement into the existing system more conveniently such as adding sensors or develop into mobile wireless sensor network system, which one-to-many communication concept must be apply. It should be noted that this study is using the existed cloud platform service, so the delay of cloud platform itself is inevitable as it shares resources with many registered user at the same time and server issue must also be taken into the consideration. However, with the advantages of MQTT protocol combined with cloud platform and idea of the internet of things, this concept proves to be possible to be adapted into the research of remotely robot control for practical usage purpose.
		本文提出了利用MQTT云平台进行机器人远程控制和GPS跟踪的研究。通过使用MQTT作为通信协议，该系统具有较低的整体数据包大小，从而比传统的HTTP协议具有更低的传输时间。此外，根据MQTT通信原理，该系统可以更方便地在现有系统中实现新的系统或应用，例如在移动无线传感器网络系统中添加传感器或开发传感器网络系统，必须应用一对多的通信概念，因此具有进一步发展的优势。需要注意的是，本研究使用的是现有的云平台服务，因此云平台本身的延迟是不可避免的，因为它同时与多个注册用户共享资源，还必须考虑服务器问题。然而，由于MQTT协议结合云平台和物联网思想的优势，这一概念被证明有可能应用于机器人远程控制的研究中，以达到实际应用的目的。
